System Architecture Specification

Overview:
This document describes the architecture of a scalable machine learning platform designed for real-time inference and batch processing.

Components:
1. Data Ingestion Layer
   - Apache Kafka for streaming data
   - AWS S3 for batch data storage
   - Data validation and preprocessing

2. Model Training Pipeline
   - MLflow for experiment tracking
   - Kubernetes for distributed training
   - Model versioning and registry

3. Inference Engine
   - REST API endpoints
   - Model serving with TensorFlow Serving
   - Auto-scaling based on load

4. Monitoring and Observability
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for visualization
   - ELK stack for logging

5. Security
   - OAuth 2.0 authentication
   - TLS encryption
   - Network segmentation

Performance Requirements:
- Latency: < 100ms for real-time inference
- Throughput: > 1000 requests/second
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Scalability: Auto-scale from 2 to 100 instances

Data Flow:
Raw Data → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Model Deployment → Inference → Results

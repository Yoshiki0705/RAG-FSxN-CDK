Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled training data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in data without labels
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment

Popular Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest

Applications:
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Fraud Detection
- Autonomous Vehicles

The field continues to evolve rapidly with advances in deep learning, transformer architectures, and large language models.

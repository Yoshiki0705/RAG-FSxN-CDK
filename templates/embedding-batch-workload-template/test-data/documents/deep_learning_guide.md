# Deep Learning Guide

## Introduction
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

## Neural Network Architecture
### Basic Components
- **Neurons**: Basic processing units
- **Layers**: Collections of neurons
- **Weights**: Connection strengths between neurons
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear transformations

### Common Architectures
1. **Feedforward Networks**
   - Simple multilayer perceptrons
   - Used for basic classification and regression

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - Specialized for image processing
   - Use convolution operations to detect features

3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
   - Handle sequential data
   - Include LSTM and GRU variants

4. **Transformer Networks**
   - Attention-based architecture
   - State-of-the-art for NLP tasks

## Training Process
1. Forward propagation
2. Loss calculation
3. Backpropagation
4. Parameter updates

## Applications
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Game Playing (AlphaGo, Chess)
- Drug Discovery
